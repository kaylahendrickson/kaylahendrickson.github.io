hello, hola, salut. 

### briefly

I'm a **materials engineer and UX designer** by training. No, those are not at all related, but I enjoyed both.

I went back to training for an **M.S. in Global Health**, because access to healthcare for everyone, everywhere is something I believe in. 

I now work in **pharmacoepidemiology and causal inference**. It's hard, it's fun, it's pushing my stats knowledge to the precarious limit.  

I'm a **writer** by choice. No training involved, which may be obvious.

I consider myself, above all else, to be **an artist, and a human**.  



### less briefly

I'm from **Tallahasee, FL**. (Make your Florida jokes now; I've heard them all.) 

I moved to Atlanta to attend university at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I completed a **B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering**, a major that doesn't fit in most job application forms. They don't tell you that when you pick it. 

I worked as a **STEM Tutor** at two high schools on the South side of Atlanta while getting a certificate in **UX Design**. These experiences could not have been more different, but both were important in shaping how I think about systems, fairness, usability, and communication. 

I spent a year and half working at the non-profit **Bridges to Development**. I can't put into words how grateful I am for my time there. This is where I learned about Global Public Health, the health challenges faced by our poorest people, and the intricate system of entities working within the global aid and development industry. 

I went back to school for an **M.S. in Global Health** at Duke University. During that time, I spent 2 months in **Kisumu, Kenya** conducting research on **cervical cancer prevention**. 

I am currently interning at a small company out of **Durham, NC** called **Target RWE**. We study the effectiveness and safety of drugs in the "real world" - outside a clincial trial - using advanced techniques in causal inference. 

In my free time, **I rock climb, read, write, and hang out with my dog Ruby.**
